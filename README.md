## Abstract

In the current era of increasing data abundance, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have brought advances to the landscape of chemical risk assessment. This interactive session will delve into the intersection of AI and chemical risk assessment, with a specific focus on the latest developments from the past three years. Participants will be introduced to the fundamental concepts of AI and Chemical Risk Assessment and the applications of AI in risk assessment, hazard identification, exposure monitoring, and regulatory compliance. Through an exploration of Advanced AI-driven approaches, attendees will gain insights into the applications, benefits, and challenges associated with these techniques. By participating in this summer school, attendees will deepen their understanding of AI's potential to significantly advance chemical risk assessment practices, paving the way for a safer world by harnessing available data and knowledge. This session offers attendees a unique opportunity to actively engage with recent advancements in AI-assisted chemical risk assessment through the hands-on application of innovative methodologies. By exploring these cutting-edge approaches, participants will gain practical knowledge and valuable insights to navigate the new and evolving landscape of risk assessment effectively. The group will unlock and test the potential of the latest AI concepts and methodologies and enhance their understanding of their real-world implications. Additionally, a follow-up hackathon week (14 - 18 August) will be organised, providing hands-on development and testing of group ideas, models, and services for further exploration.
